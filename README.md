#### The Odin Project
---

This is my personal repository for archive all exercices from ``The Odin Project`` that I've made so far. PR, issues, clean code suggestions and any sort of valid criticism about all the HTML/CSS/JS stuff are welcome. 

This branch contain my ``finished-at-the-learning`` code. That means it will contain my beginner and untouchable code. Throughout my learning path, some of these projects will be remade or refactored on the ``updated`` branch.

At the moment, I've completed:

- [Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) 
- [Rock, paper and scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors)

``Note: my CSS code at the moment is not pixel-perfect``
